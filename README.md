##Rules of Ghost

Players form a word by alternating turns saying a letter, which is added on to the end of the word fragment. There are two ways to lose Ghost:

1. Forming a word longer than 3 letters ("PEA" is ok, but "PEAR" is not).

2. Creating a fragment (of any size) which cannot become a word by adding more letters (for example, "QZ").
